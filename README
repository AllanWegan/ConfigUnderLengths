ConfigUnderLengths allows to configure the amount of tiles, underground pipes and belts can skip.

To be used with pure vanilla or mods that add or change tiers of underground pipes and/or belts.

Supports setting the skippable tiles (maximum underground distance) of up to 5 tiers of pipes and 8 tiers of belts. Pipes/belts above tier 5/8 will inherit settings for tier 5/8.
Allows to change selected tiers of pipes and/or belts only. Default values of -1 indicate to not change the value set by vanilla or mods.
Tiers are detected by skippable tiles defined before applying configured values.

Does not add any tiers itself and executes no code after the data-final-fixes phase for maximum mod compatibility. Tested with vanilla and bob's logistics, but should work fine with all mods not adding or altering underground pipes or belts in the data-final-fixes phase.
